# Redis Repeater

Constantly transfer all Redis items from one queue to the same queue on another machine.
Great if you want to have multiple Resque/Redis machines, but only want the jobs to run on one of them.  With `redis-repeater`, you temporarily stage them on local machines so your application doesn't need to make calls across the world.

## Quick Start

1.  Set up configuration files as below
2.  `gem install redis-repeater`
3.  `redis-repeater start /path/to/config/directory/config.yml`
3.  `redis-repeater stop`

## Configuration

``` yaml
servers:
  one:
    host: localhost
    port: 6379
  two:
    host: localhost
    port: 6380

repeats:
  - queue: queue_name
    source: one
    timeout: 0
    maintain_count: true
    destinations:
      - server: two
        queue: queue_name_change

log: /path/to/repeater.log
```

## Resque Queues

If you specify a queue named `resque:queue:*`, all of your resque queues will be repeated

Lower repeats on individual queues will override these.

## Maintaining Counts

In config.yml, if you include `maintain_count:true`, counts will be maintained for the number of repeated items in queues named: `redis-repeater:#{queue_name}:count`

## **Note on 0.2.0**

Version `0.2.0` is a rewrite, and there are large changes to the configuration format.  Please check your configs before upgrading.
